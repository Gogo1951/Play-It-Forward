    Environment probing and state capture for bug reports, not unit tests. WoW's
    sandboxed Lua has no assertion runner, so everything here is read-only and
    side-effect free. The one exception is the explicit Taint Log button, which
    sets the taintLog CVar. Reports build only on a button press, never on load
    or panel open.

    the "initialize on PLAYER_LOGIN" rule applies only to SavedVariables, which
    don't exist until the client loads them. This is a plain namespace table, so
    it starts false at every login and is never persisted.

    outputs holds each report tab's one output box (settings, code, data,
    localization),
    status each report's last run state, and running the tab whose run is in
    flight, or nil.
